# Youtube Backend

This project is a complex backend project that is built with nodejs, expressjs, mongodb, mongoose, jwt, bcrypt, and many more. This project is a complete backend project that has all the features that a backend project should have. I tried to build a complete video hosting website similar to youtube with all the features like login, signup, upload video, like, unlike, comment, subscribe, unsubscribe, and many more.

Project uses all standard practices like JWT, bcrypt, access tokens, refresh Tokens and many more.

Services used for storing the data- mongoDB and cloudinary

## Lessons Learned

While working on this project, I practiced various backend logics, including data modelling, error handling, middlewares, RESTFul API , Authentication, dealing with database queries, etc.

One of the key learning points was understanding and applying MongoDB aggregate pipelines, which were new concepts to me.

I also learned how to maintain industry standard code which is readable and also got to know the importance of reusable code.
